# P9 NEOVIM CONFIG

This repository contains the cofiguration for my neovim set up.
It was created on MacOS, however I will include instructions on how to set up the same environment on Windows and Linux.
I have included all the files need to have the exact same set up as my personal machine.

## Prerequisits

The following are the required dependancies for neovim and all plugins to work correctly.

    - Neovim can be install in many ways to find out how to install on your machine, see [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

    - The font I use is the Nerd Font Jetbrains mono and can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.2.1/JetBrainsMono.zip).
    - The nerd font should be set as the font in the terminal you are using (ie iTerm2 for Mac) under the profile if applicable.

    - If ripgrep is not installed then find out how to install it on your machine [here](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
